# Nov 14, 2022 Talk with Victor

1. Are the characteristics distinguishable for each unit? If not, then not much interesting to do (First thing to do)

2. Within-year variation may be too large

3. 1. Maybe the year is a better IV than draft eligibility?

   2. 1. Because there may be some cross-year variation
      2. Check Argentinian history if that’s the case
      3. Break up analysis by year - only then IV assumption can hold
      4. No not break up analysis by year - just use year as IV?

4. Binarize data: ⅓ most and ⅓ least on the treatment variable

5. Fit a few ML models and see the results (robust to the model chosen)

6. 1. Check the covariates

   2. 1. they do not seem super relevant according to Victor
      2. confounding effect is not obvious because we are taking an average of a fairly large and diverse population

7. More sophisticated: the effects still hold in other years?

Next steps:

1. Check across-unit variation
2. Check across-year variation
